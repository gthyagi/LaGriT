# demo of createpts / poisson_disk module using various arguments
#
# output01* is just the distribution of vertices without connectings as Delaunay triangles
# output02* connect the vertices as a Delaunay triangulation
# output03* is the same as output02 except the resoltion is reduced from 0.1 to 0.05
# output04* variable resolution mesh with target edge length defined in user_resolution_1.mlgi
# output05* variable resolution mesh with target edge length defined in user_resolution_2.mlgi
