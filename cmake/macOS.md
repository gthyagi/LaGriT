# MacOS Helps and Hints

LaGriT has been developed and used on MacOS machines for many years, using both Clang and GNU compilers.
For MacOS compilers and systems newer than those used in 2019, there may be issues.

LaGriT V3.3.3 builds with and without Exodus on MacOS Intel and M1 machines as long as gfortran compilers are compatible with the C++ compilers.
