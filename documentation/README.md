## LaGriT: Los Alamos Grid Toolbox old Documentation ##

The files in this directory were from LaGriT during the transition from Mercurial version control and the html web pages, moved to github version control and github pages for documentation.

Most these files and command descriptions were created before 2017, though there are some updates to the build process included in these pages that may be helpful for older machines.


See current documentation located at the top directory and manual pages under docs.
